            <h1>WEBSITES</h1>
            <p> This page is meant to document the parallel development of two websites containing
                the same content, one built with WordPress, and one built from the ground up with
                html files and hosted on GitHub.</p>
            <p>The Wordpress can be found at: <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/reeceportfolio/">Reece
                    Cullen – Portfolio (psu.edu)</a></p>
            <p>The site hosted by GitHub (you're here right now) can be found at: <a

            <h1>Reflective Essay</h1>
            <p>This website is part of a parallel website development project, being put together
                alongside another website containing almost identical content but developed in a
                different manner. This website was made from scratch with HTML and css pages created
                in oXygen XML code editor and hosted on GitHub, the other one being created in WordPress. <br /><br /> I
                technically created this website first, though iterated multiple times throughout
                the entire project. It was difficult to learn how to set everything up properly, and
                I’d say the biggest challenge was learning the basics of HTML itself. Once you
                understand how attributes, elements, and their interactions, the entire process
                became a lot easier. <br /><br /> Moreso than WordPress, creating my website with raw HTML
                pages was a truly liberated experience. I could feel how many possibilities existed
                with this method, and while it was a little overwhelming at first, I still prefer it
                over how stale it felt to create with WordPress. I will say that editing the layout
                and organization of my WordPress site was rather easier than with my HTML pages,
                mostly because WordPress does all the work for me. All I had to do was choose a
                satisfactory template, customize it a bit, and my website’s skeleton was complete.
                On the contrary, with the HTML pages, it took lots of trial and error to get the
                margins, font sizes, and the layout in the way I wanted. <br /><br /> While a basic
                understanding of code and digital concepts would be very helpful in learning how to
                create with HTML, I don’t think it’s strictly necessary. As long as one starts small
                and works their way up to more complicated concepts, I think anyone could learn
                HTML. I’d like to learn how to make my site look sleeker, though maybe I could
                already and am just too attached to commitments I’ve made already. <br /><br /> All said,
                I much prefer creating a site with raw HTML files thanks to the creative freedom and
                customizability provided, but my experience with WordPress was anything but
                unpleasant. Go check out the Websites page on my WordPress site to see my reflection
                essay on my experience with that site’s creation. <br /><br />
