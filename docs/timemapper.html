            <h1>TIME MAPPER</h1>
            <p> This page is meant to hold my Time Mapper visual learning aid created on <a
                    href="https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/">the Time Mapper website</a>. I decided
                to document the brief history of coffee, as I think there are some interesting
                parallels between the bean-based drink's popularity and other social movements that
                happened around the same time.</p>

                 style="border: none;" width="1150" height="780"></iframe>
            <p>The common thread I was trying to weave with this timeline is the parallel evolution of coffee and its popularity with the development of intellectual movements 
            based around the challenging of the status quo. For centuries, beer, a 'downer' substance, was the drink of choice for England, all throughout the Middle Ages. 
            Then, just as coffee starts spreading around the world, so too do new ideas begin to take shape, both in England with the Royal Society being formed out of a coffeehouse
             club, and with the Revolution sprouting in the American colonies. </p>
