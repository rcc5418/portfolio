            <p>This page will record my experiences while doing my internship with <a
                    href="https://www.collegeknowledgefoundation.org" target="_blank">the College
                    Knowledge Foundtation</a> as an Editor/Web Designer (Summer 2024)!</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 1: 5/13 - 5/17</span><br /> -Aquainted myself with
                various task-management/website design softwares to use with the team<br />
                -Attended my first meetings and met all my collegaues at College Knowledge.<br />
                -Completed various onboarding tasks, like reviewing the employee handbook and
                mission statement<br /> This first week has been mostly about getting aqcuainted
                with the efficiency tools College Knowledge utilizes in their operations, like
                ClickUp and various Google services like Calendar. Something else I did was watch
                some TED Talk clips from Simon Senek, an inspirational speaker, about concepts like
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCB-0LWAmxw" target="_blank">Infinite
                    vs Finite players</a>, and about focusing your motivation around the the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ss78LfY3nE" target="_blank">'Why'</a>.
                Honestly, pretty interesting stuff! </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 2: 5/20 - 5/24</span><br /> -Met with the
                marketing team for the first time.<br /> -Arranged future regular meetings with
                supervisor and teams.<br /> -Began working on an updated website, using <a
                    href="wix.com" target="_blank">Wix's website builder</a>.<br /> This weeks
                biggest milestone has been beginning work at designing and creating an updated,
                modern website for the College Knowledge foundation. So far, I've just been creating
                a prototype homepage using some design principles inspired by some speakers'
                websites. The website is currently hosted <a
                    href="https://www.collegeknowledgefoundation.org" target="_blank">here</a>, but
                I haven't published any changes yet, and probably won't for a while. </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 3: 5/27 - 5/31</span><br /> -Polished up the
                website's homepage redesign.<br /> -Edited my first short for the Foundation,
                including re-edits/adjustments .<br /> This weeks biggest milestone was definitely
                beginning my editing work creating short-form video content for the College
                Knowledge Foundation. I'm doing this by using CapCut, which is an editing software I
                hadn't worked with before, but it's actually pretty simple and intuitive, so I think
                I've gotten the hang of it quickly. I'm looking forward to making more videos! </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 4: 6/3 - 6/7</span><br /> -Tweaked the website's
                menu and moved forward with more page redesigns.<br /> -Edited three more reels,
                expirementing with different variables and animations<br /> This week, we've planned
                alot for more operations in the future, including me possibly going to an in-person
                College Knowledge information session to record video, which is pretty exciting.
                Other than that, I worked a lot more with CapCut to polish the short videos, and
                look forward to adjusting our formula more over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 5: 6/10 - 6/14</span><br /> -Redesigned more web
                pages.<br /> -Learned more about Wix's capabilities, adjusting list items to create
                a smoother user experience when exploring the site.<br /> -Created a prototype loop
                animation for use in our reels in Adobe Premiere.<br />We've been planning ahead a
                bit when it comes to future summer operations, including the prospect of me acting
                as a videographer for a future College Knowledge operation in July. Other than that,
                we've also been discussing different options for specific website optics and
                marketing content. I'm looking forward to creating more kinds of content for the
                socials!</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 6: 6/17 - 6/21</span><br /> -Started the website
                re-haul, creating many new pages and restructuring existing ones<br /> -Began
                working with the podcast content, creating long-form videos and planning additional
                reel content<br /> This week has been a bit difficult as I've been assigned more
                work than previous weeks while other obstacles have appeared in my life, but
                learning to juggle these tasks is part of the growing I'm hoping to achieve over
                this summer. Regardless, there's lots of work to be done in the next week!</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 7: 6/24 - 6/28</span><br /> -Followed through with
                website rehaul, creating more new pages and ensuring they link together
                competently<br /> This week has been all about making sure the website is ready for
                an influx of users after Donovin starts doing some in-person sessions at Lycoming
                College next week. This has involved some close discussion with Donovin Lindsay on
                how to display some of our services, as well as the assurance the rehaul would be
                complete by next week. The website is in a good place right now. There are several
                pages I wish to redesign still, but nothing of urgency. Next week I should be able
                to work more on short/podcast video content while preparing to record one of
                Donovin's sessions in person in two weeks.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 8: 7/1 - 7/5</span><br /> -Continuted development
                of video content, including integrating correct branding when necessary and evolving
                the short video process.<br /> Much of the important website content has been
                completed, with more pages being planned on being rewritten/redesigned but waiting
                on content to move forward with it. In lieu of other pertinent tasks, I've been
                working on developing College Knowledge's video content for their social media
                platforms, including podcast content. Next week, I hope to do more work like this
                while also meeting with Donovin and recoring one of his presentations.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 9: 7/8 - 7/12 <em>BIRTHDAY WEEK!</em></span><br />
                -Continued developing video content for various social media platforms, with various
                types of videos produced.<br /> -Designed/developed further web pages using content
                written by other team members<br /> -Met with supervisor to record live lecture
                content at the <a href="https://www.pfew.org" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Free
                    Enterprise Week</a>.<br /> This week I have been a man of many hats, but I
                appreciate the variety! The way I see it, by performing these different tasks it
                keeps each individual skillset sharp. Next week I should do more of the same,
                possibly editing the content I recorded at PFEW for future use.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 10: 7/15 - 7/19</span><br /> -Continued
                development of video content for social media<br /> -Began rehaul of several website
                pages for mobile view<br /> -Handled lecture video content to ensure high quality
                footage for later use<br /> This week I've been handling a lot of what I'd call busy
                work, which is mostly just following up on other tasks I'd begun earlier, like
                editing short videos and handling website content differently. I'm not sure what
                will come up next, but the next week may bring further web-page redesigns/rehauls
                along with more videos to be edited.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 10: 7/22 - 7/26</span><br /> -Concluded website
                rehaul for mobile viewing, ensuring consistent quality over multiple platforms<br />
                -Edited new podcast content, including longform and shortform content to be used for
                promotion<br /> There's more website work to be done, but much of it will be done in
                collaboration with other people on the marketing team. Additionally, we're beginning
                a new season of the podcast, so I have some more content to handle in the meantime,
                which is what Ill be working on this week. I've also discussed my position with my
                supervisor and decided to stay on until the Summer's conclusion, possibly staying on
                in a smaller position during the school year.</p>
