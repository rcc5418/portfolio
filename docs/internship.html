            <p>This page will record my experiences while doing my internship with <a
                    href="https://www.collegeknowledgefoundation.org" target="_blank">the College
                    Knowledge Foundtation</a> as an Editor/Web Designer (Summer 2024)!</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 1: 5/13 - 5/17</span><br /> -Aquainted myself with
                various task-management/website design softwares to use with the team<br />
                -Attended my first meetings and met all my collegaues at College Knowledge.<br />
                -Completed various onboarding tasks, like reviewing the employee handbook and
                mission statement<br /> This first week has been mostly about getting aqcuainted
                with the efficiency tools College Knowledge utilizes in their operations, like
                ClickUp and various Google services like Calendar. Something else I did was watch
                some TED Talk clips from Simon Senek, an inspirational speaker, about concepts like
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCB-0LWAmxw" target="_blank">Infinite
                    vs Finite players</a>, and about focusing your motivation around the the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ss78LfY3nE" target="_blank">'Why'</a>. Honestly, pretty interesting stuff!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 2: 5/20 - 5/24</span><br /> -Met with the marketing team for the first time.<br />
                -Arranged future regular meetings with supervisor and teams.<br />
                -Began working on an updated website, using <a href="wix.com" target="_blank">Wix's website builder</a>.<br /> 
                This weeks biggest milestone has been beginning work at designing and creating an updated, modern website for the College Knowledge foundation. So far, I've just been creating a prototype homepage using some design principles inspired by some speakers' websites.
                The website is currently hosted <a href="https://www.collegeknowledgefoundation.org" target="_blank">here</a>, but I haven't published any changes yet, and probably won't for a while.
