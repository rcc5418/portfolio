            <p>This page will record my experiences while doing my internship with <a
                    href="https://www.collegeknowledgefoundation.org" target="_blank">the College
                    Knowledge Foundtation</a> as an Editor/Web Designer (Summer 2024)!</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 1: 5/13 - 5/17</span><br /> -Aquainted myself with
                various task-management/website design softwares to use with the team<br />
                -Attended my first meetings and met all my collegaues at College Knowledge.<br />
                -Completed various onboarding tasks, like reviewing the employee handbook and
                mission statement<br /> This first week has been mostly about getting aqcuainted
                with the efficiency tools College Knowledge utilizes in their operations, like
                ClickUp and various Google services like Calendar. Something else I did was watch
                some TED Talk clips from Simon Senek, an inspirational speaker, about concepts like
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCB-0LWAmxw" target="_blank">Infinite
                    vs Finite players</a>, and about focusing your motivation around the the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ss78LfY3nE" target="_blank">'Why'</a>.
                Honestly, pretty interesting stuff! </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 2: 5/20 - 5/24</span><br /> -Met with the
                marketing team for the first time.<br /> -Arranged future regular meetings with
                supervisor and teams.<br /> -Began working on an updated website, using <a
                    href="wix.com" target="_blank">Wix's website builder</a>.<br /> This weeks
                biggest milestone has been beginning work at designing and creating an updated,
                modern website for the College Knowledge foundation. So far, I've just been creating
                a prototype homepage using some design principles inspired by some speakers'
                websites. The website is currently hosted <a
                    href="https://www.collegeknowledgefoundation.org" target="_blank">here</a>, but
                I haven't published any changes yet, and probably won't for a while. </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 3: 5/27 - 5/31</span><br /> -Polished up the
                website's homepage redesign.<br /> -Edited my first short for the Foundation,
                including re-edits/adjustments .<br /> This weeks biggest milestone was definitely
                beginning my editing work creating short-form video content for the College
                Knowledge Foundation. I'm doing this by using CapCut, which is an editing software I
                hadn't worked with before, but it's actually pretty simple and intuitive, so I think
                I've gotten the hang of it quickly. I'm looking forward to making more videos! </p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 4: 6/3 - 6/7</span><br /> -Tweaked the website's
                menu and moved forward with more page redesigns.<br /> -Edited three more reels,
                expirementing with different variables and animations<br /> This week, we've planned
                alot for more operations in the future, including me possibly going to an in-person
                College Knowledge information session to record video, which is pretty exciting.
                Other than that, I worked a lot more with CapCut to polish the short videos, and
                look forward to adjusting our formula more over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="character_name">Week 5: 6/10 - 6/14</span><br /> -Redesigned more web
                pages.<br /> -Learned more about Wix's capabilities, adjusting list items to create
                a smoother user experience when exploring the site.<br /> -Created a prototype loop
                animation for use in our reels in Adobe Premiere.<br />We've been planning ahead a
                bit when it comes to future summer operations, including the prospect of me acting
                as a videographer for a future College Knowledge operation in July. Other than that,
                we've also been discussing different options for specific website optics and
                marketing content. I'm looking forward to creating more kinds of content for the
                socials!</p>
