            <h1>Text Corpus Analysis</h1>
            <p> This page is meant to document my Text Comparison Corpus Analysis project, where
                I'll take a look at several different text files and compare and contrast their
                characteristics, like repeated phrases, common words, and how often they appear. The
                texts I'll be taking a look at are Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>, Mary Shelly's
                    <i>Frankenstien</i>, and Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>.The reason I wanted
                to look at these three books is because they all introduced literary characters who
                would become massive cultural icons, spawning countless references and adaptations.
                I thought it could be interesting to identify unique aspects of each work and see
                how they could have contributed to their modern relevance.</p>
            <p>The first thing I wanted to do was check how often, and when in the text, the titular
                characters appeared. By using AntConc's Plot window and searching for specific
                terms, I can see the density of those terms' appearences in the text. First, I
                looked at <i>Moby Dick</i>, searching both for the terms 'Moby Dick' and 'white
                whale'.</p>

            <p>As is visible in these graphs, Moby Dick is absent at the beginning of the story,
                until he's introduced by Ahab once the plot starts to kick up. He isn't very present
                for a large portion of the story, until the final battle when he attacks the
                    <i>Pequod</i> for the final time.</p>

            </section>
            <p> In <i>Dracula</i>, the title character isn't mentioned by name that frequently, with
                only 34 mentions across the 250+ pages. This could be because he is referred to by
                his title, 'The Count', as seen with the plot frequency graph of 'count', though
                that could be a completely normal use of the word 'count' as well. Regardless, it's
                clear that Dracula himself doesn't appear too frequently in the novel. Instead, much
                of the book's gothic horror is derived from the nature of the world, a warped
                reality where the dead can rise from their graves and must be slain to protect the
                living. From a certain point of view, focusing too much on a single character as the
                'main villain' could detract from that feeling of near-existential horror. </p>

            <p>The word 'Frankenstein' appears surprisingly few times in the aptly named text, but
                this time there's a simple explanation. The creature called Frankenstein today
                wasn't given a name at all in their literary debut Instead, the title
                    <i>Frankenstein</i> refers to the main character, Victor Frankenstein. As the
                book is mostly told from his first-person point of view, his last name isn't
                mentioned very much. Frankenstein's monster is called a series of derogatory names
                portrayed in the images above, like 'monster', 'creature', and 'fiend' (it's no
                wonder they cursed their creator).</p>

                    'monster'</figcaption></figure>
            <p>In order to draw a conclusion from this comparison, take a look at all the plot
                frequency graphs together. The most noticable common thread between all of them is
                that in all instances, there's a large area of blank space where the character is
                unmentioned or absent, and this makes sense. I've always thought that a a great
                character is discernable when they can have an enormous impact without being
                explicitly mentioned or even present at all, and such is the case for these liteary
                giants.<br /> Moby Dick doesn't physically appear until the book's climax, but he's
                present throughout the story as Ahab's main driving force. <i>Moby Dick</i> centers
                around how obsession can drive people to unreasonable and dangerous actions, and
                that theme is conveyed with how driven Ahab is about this whale which nobody else
                has even seen. In <i>Dracula</i>, the title character is but part of a larger issue
                -- the ungodly existence of vampirism itself. As Dracula dissapears from the plot
                for a large portion of the novel, the atmosphere of gothic horror is sustained by
                the world's uncanny features. In <i>Frankenstein</i>, it's essential that the
                monster be absent, at least for the very beginning of the story. <i>Frankenstein</i>
                is often lauded as the first true science fiction story, and in a similar vein to
                the sci-fi stories of today, it's important to establish the world the story takes
                place in, so that the implications of all the deviations from the norm can be fully
                appreciated.</p>

            </section>
            <p>To conclude, I enjoyed how visiting these classic texts through this unique vise
                helped me appreciate each of their special aspects. In today's world we are
                experiencing a bit of an intellectual property draught, as sometimes it can feel
                like every company on the planet is looking for some near-forgotten character they
                can make a quick buck off of, but I feel as if that's a fundamental misunderstaning
                of what makes a character great. More than just recognizability, a character must be
                useful for the story their written with, ideally leaving a memorable impression
                while also making use of absence to make their presence felt even stronger.</p>
