            <h1>Text Corpus Analysis</h1>
            <p> This page is meant to document my Text Comparison Corpus Analysis project, where
                I'll take a look at several different text files and compare and contrast their
                characteristics, like repeated phrases, common words, and how often they appear. The
                texts I'll be taking a look at are Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>, Mary Shelly's
                    <i>Frankenstien</i>, and Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>.The reason I wanted
                to look at these three books is because they all introduced literary characters who
                would become massive cultural icons, spawning countless references and adaptations.
                I thought it could be interesting to identify unique aspects of each work and see
                how they could have contributed to their modern relevance. <br />For this
                assignment, I mostly used the online program at <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/"
                    target="_blank">Voyant</a> and the <a
                    href="https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/" target="_blank">AntConc
                    software available for download online</a>.</p>
            <p>The first thing I wanted to do was check how often, and when in the text, the titular
                characters appeared. By using AntConc's Plot window and searching for specific
                terms, I can see the density of those terms' appearences in the text. First, I
                looked at <i>Moby Dick</i>, searching both for the terms 'Moby Dick' and 'white
                whale'.</p>

            <p>As is visible in these graphs, Moby Dick is absent at the beginning of the story,
                until he's introduced by Ahab once the plot starts to kick up. He isn't very present
                for a large portion of the story, until the final battle when he attacks the
                    <i>Pequod</i> for the final time.<br />

            </section>
            <p> In <i>Dracula</i>, the title character isn't mentioned by name that frequently, with
                only 34 mentions across the 250+ pages. This could be because he is referred to by
                his title, 'The Count', as seen with the plot frequency graph of 'count', though
                that could be a completely normal use of the word 'count' as well. Regardless, it's
                clear that Dracula himself doesn't appear too frequently in the novel. Instead, much
                of the book's gothic horror is derived from the nature of the world, a warped
                reality where the dead can rise from their graves and must be slain to protect the
                living. From a certain point of view, focusing too much on a single character as the
                'main villain' could detract from that feeling of near-existential horror.<br />

            <p>The word 'Frankenstein' appears surprisingly few times in the aptly named text, but
                this time there's a simple explanation. The creature called Frankenstein today
                wasn't given a name at all in their literary debut Instead, the title
                    <i>Frankenstein</i> refers to the main character, Victor Frankenstein. As the
                book is mostly told from his first-person point of view, his last name isn't
                mentioned very much. Frankenstein's monster is called a series of derogatory names
                portrayed in the images above, like 'monster', 'creature', and 'fiend' (it's no
                wonder they cursed their creator). <br />

            <p>In order to draw a conclusion from this comparison, take a look at all the plot
                frequency graphs together. The most noticable common thread between all of them is
                that in all instances, there's a large area of blank space where the character is
                unmentioned or absent, and this makes sense. I've always thought that a a great
                character is discernable when they can have an enormous impact without being
                explicitly mentioned or even present at all, and such is the case for these liteary
                giants.<br /> Moby Dick doesn't physically appear until the book's climax, but he's
                present throughout the story as Ahab's main driving force. <i>Moby Dick</i> centers
                around how obsession can drive people to unreasonable and dangerous actions, and
                that theme is conveyed with how driven Ahab is about this whale which nobody else
                has even seen. In <i>Dracula</i>, the title character is but part of a larger issue
                -- the ungodly existence of vampirism itself. As Dracula dissapears from the plot
                for a large portion of the novel, the atmosphere of gothic horror is sustained by
                the world's uncanny features. In <i>Frankenstein</i>, it's essential that the
                monster be absent, at least for the very beginning of the story. <i>Frankenstein</i>
                is often lauded as the first true science fiction story, and in a similar vein to
                the sci-fi stories of today, it's important to establish the world the story takes
                place in, so that the implications of all the deviations from the norm can be fully
                appreciated.</p>

            </section>
            <p>To conclude this portion, I'd like to say I enjoyed how visiting these classic texts
                through this unique vise helped me appreciate each of their special aspects. In
                today's world we are experiencing a bit of an intellectual property draught, as
                sometimes it can feel like every company on the planet is looking for some
                near-forgotten character they can make a quick buck off of, but I feel as if that's
                a fundamental misunderstaning of what makes a character great. More than just
                recognizability, a character must be useful for the story their written with,
                ideally leaving a memorable impression while also making use of absence to make
                their presence felt even stronger.</p>
            <p>Another method I wanted to emply was AntConc's N-Gram search system. By entering all
                three of my text files at the same time, I could search for repeating phrases and
                see instances from all files at the same time. With this method I should be able to
                see what groups of words all the texts use.</p>

                     /><figcaption>The phrase frequency of 'and at the same

                     /><figcaption>The phrase frequency of 'i do not know'</figcaption></figure>
            <p>Some of the most common repeated phrases throuought the texts were common word-chains
                that you might not be surprised to see today. 'at the same time' pops up a good
                number of times in <i>Dracula</i> and <i>Moby Dick</i>, and slightly less in
                    <i>Frankenstein</i>. This discrepancy <i>could</i> be explained by the
                difference in time periods the books were written in. <i>Frankenstein</i> was
                written in 1818, <i>Moby Dick</i> was completed in 1851, and <i>Dracula</i> was
                published in 1897. The gaps in years might seem arbitrary at first glance, after
                all, the gap in years from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Moby Dick</i> is shorter than
                that between <i>Moby Dick</i> and <i>Dracula</i>, so what could be gleaned from
                similarites between the latter two texts? I believe that the discrepancy of the
                number of uses of certain phrases can be explained by the nature of literature as a
                medium. Much like other forms of media, books, poems, and the like are affected by
                the changing of the times, they're constantly shifting and evolving through
                different trends. It could be that between 1818 and 1850, when Melville began
                writing <i>Moby Dick</i>, that the medium of books changed enough that Melville's
                take on dramatic fiction would turn out far differently. If that's the case then,
                why are there many similar phrases in <i>Moby Dick</i> and <i>Dracula</i>? Was
                Stoker's novel just derivative? I don't think so. I'd bet that the shifting
                literatue culture plateaued between 1850 and 1900, much like most cultures do with
                time. It's what makes certain novels still accessible to today's reading audience,
                while other works aren't enjoyed by most. Surely we've all heard of No Fear
                Shakespeare, which rewrites classic Shakespeare stories for a modern, more casual
                audience. Would you be surprised to learn that a similar thing has been done with
                    <i>Frankenstein</i>?</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, <i>Dracula</i> has been retold again and again with virtually no changes
                to the original text. No, I mean, <a
                    href="https://www.polygon.com/23063882/dracula-daily-tumblr-memes"
                    target="_blank">it's been literally virtually rereleased on

                https://www.polygon.com/23063882/dracula-daily-tumblr-memes<br />This change in
                writing style, from what could be called 'outdated' to a modern writing style, could
                be what's being reflected in some of these repeated phrases we can see.<br />Of
                course, a much simpler answer to this little myster could be the books' lengths.
                    <i>Frankenstein</i> has substantially fewer pages than our other texts, about
                160-200 pages as compared to <i>Dracula</i>'s 260 pages and <i>Moby Dick</i>'s
                monstrous 350+ pages. I think that there are too many discrepencies in phrase
                repetition for a length-difference to factor in that much. Besides, it's much more
                interesting to discuss it from an alternate point of view, in my opinion at
                least.</p>
