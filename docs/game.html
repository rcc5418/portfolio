            <p><a href="https://memoryofgod.itch.io/where-the-goats-are">Where the Goats Are</a> is
                an indie game developed by Memory of God originally released in 2017. The game
                follows Tikvah, a woman surviving in a lonely world that's quickly falling to
                pieces.</p>

                    farm</figcaption></figure>
            <p>One of the most striking things about WTGA is its simple yet striking artsyle. The
                world is constrained to a single screen, depicting only Tikvah's home and its
                inhabitants. Everything in the game is depicted with simple polyganal 3D objects,
                inviting the player's imagination to create their own image of the world.</p>

            </section>
            <p>The game itself is simple enough to control and play. The player directs Tikvah by
                clicking objects on the screen, and she'll slowly plod around her tiny farm, picking
                up objects and carrying out simple actions as the player dictates. The only
                customization the player has over the experience is when they first enter the game,
                where they can change the resolution the game will display at. I think this is fine
                for what the game delivers, as it's more important to control how the game is
                consumed when it's as short and story-focused as this one is.</p>
            <figure><img src="images/WTGA_gameplay_1.png" /><figcaption>Tikvah reads a letter from a
                    friend</figcaption></figure>
            <p>On the screen the player is confined in, there are a number of actions they can take.
                By milking Tikvah's goats, you can make cheese to trade with the postman, and by
                walking to the watering hole, you can water a plant and watch it grow over time.
                There are other tasks that must be done, like feeding the goats, but all these
                actions are pointless in how the game plays out. It may seem unengaging for the
                player to have their actions be pointless, but the focus of the game is its story,
                and the futility of the player's actions factors into the hopeless tone the story
                paints. </p>

            </section>
            <p> The story itself is engaging, but morose. Told mostly through letters that Tikvah
                recieves from friends and relatives, the world seems to be falling apart, as
                numerous letters warn of a scourge sweeping the land, coming for Tikvah and her
                goats. I appreciate how the hopeless nature of the world Tikvah inhabits is
                reflected in the game's orienteering. The entirety of Tikvah's world is contained on
                a single screen, one that Tikvah cannot escape. In the same way, Tikvah's entire
                world as a character is on her farm, as through the actions the player can take in
                the game it's shown how much Tikvah cares for her goats. Moving to the city like her
                correspondents would be impossible without leaving everything she has, a choice that
                is impossible to make, both for Tikvah and the player. </p>

                interactable objects in the game as well as most of the cosmetic ones, and their
                relationships to each other. It's impressive that a game with so little content on
                the surface can be as deep as Where the Goats Are is.</p>
