            <p>My name is Reece, a DIGIT student looking to work in game design/development. My
                hobbies include reading, video games, and making videos. On this site, I'll post
                some of the stuff I've made/worked on!</p>
            <p>There'll be a lot of different stuff on here. I'd like to be a 'jack of all trades'
                type of person.</p>

            <p>In Fall 2022, I worked with a group of classmates to create a text-based sci-fi
