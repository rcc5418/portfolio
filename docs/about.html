            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a senior, he plans to go into game
                design and development. <br />On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching,
                whatever book I'm reading, or whatever game I'm playing. I thought it would be fun
                to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my work!</p>
            <br />

                <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Currently Playing: Darkest
                        Dungeon II</span><br />I was so excited when I found out that Darkest
                    Dungeon had a sequel when I started getting into it, but I'm a bit dissapointed.
                    The artstyle <i>flourishes</i> far more than I thought it would in three
                    dimensions, and overall I like the gameplay's transition from chaotic and random
                    to intensly strategic. But there are some gripes that <i>really</i> get in my
                    way of enjoying the game! For one, there are so many status effects and menus,
                    and I found them all far more difficult to parse than the previous game.
                    Additionally, this game feels way <i>slower</i> than DD1. It feels like offense
                    has been nerfed and defensive strategies have been buffed, so oftentimes,
                    buckling down and taking the long game is the most viable strategy. HOWEVER,
                    numerous enemies pierce your defenses with DOTs, like bleed blight or burn, and
                    the further into the game you progress, the more the enemies are buffed with
                    massive healthpools which ENSURE that EVERY SINGLE BATTLE lasts TEN MINUTES OR
                    MORE<br /> Anyway I can't recommend the game unless you like unfair experiences
                    and overcoming the odds. I'll still beat it though.</p>

                        Honor</span><br />Your Honor is a show that feels carried by the cast, but
                    that's always felt like a fake criticism, you know? It's like calling a movie
                    emotionally manipulative because of the music, or something. As a drama, Your
                    Honor is both crazy and predictable, exciting and boring, a true contradiction
                    of a series. The writing is lacking, which I'd cite as the main reason I'm not
                    more passionate about the show. The twists and turns feel too choreagraphed, and
                    some of the scenario-writing is fundamentally flawed. If you really like Bryan
                    Cranston, I'd check it out!</p>
