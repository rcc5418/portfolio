            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a junior, he plans to go into game
                design and development. <br />On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching,
                whatever book I'm reading, or whatever game I'm playing. I thought it would be fun
                to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my work!</p>

                        and the Thousand-Year Door</span><br />Paper Mario is a really interesting
                    game series. Originally, it was called Mario Story, but the name changed to
                    Paper Mario for English localization. The most recent games have relied too much
                    on gimmicky craft worlds, instead of engaging stories or gameplay, at least
                    that's the opinion of many. I have to agree that the classic Paper Mario games
                    are a lot more fun than the modern ones, yet \ despite having heard how good
                    Paper Mario TTYD was, I've never played it, in fact, I know virtually nothing
                    about the game, and I'm really excited to play it for the first time.</p>

                <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Currently Watching: One
                        Piece</span><br />One piece is infamous for being praised by nearly everyone
                    while also being <em>very</em> long. As in, >1000 episodes of TV. Quite frankly,
                    that's too long, and the anime's pacing is rather slow often. So, even though it's technically cheating, I actually have been reading more One Piece than I've been
                    watching these days. <br /> The story tells of a young boy who wants to become
                    the king of the pirates, sailing across the world while picking up new friend
                    after new friend. Their adventures get preeeetty wacky! <br />I'm a big fan of how this world treats powers, especially early on. </p>

                        Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)</span><br />Funnily enough, even
                    though Game of Thrones was a <em>HUGE</em> phenomenon a couple years ago, I
                    managed to stay almost completely blind to all the spoilers! I've started to
                    read the book series, and it's really good so far! It's more of a political
                    thriller than a fantasy adventure, but it's still pretty gripping! <br />(I have
                    a hard time keeping the characters straight though...)</p>
