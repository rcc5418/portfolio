            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a junior, he plans to go into game
                design and development. <br />On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching,
                whatever book I'm reading, or whatever game I'm playing. I thought it would be fun
                to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my work!</p>
            <br />

                    deeper into the mud. A dizzying blow! Witness how quickly the tide turns. Light,
                    the promise of safety. </p>

                <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Currently Watching: One
                        Piece</span><br />One piece is infamous for being praised by nearly everyone
                    while also being <em>very</em> long. As in, >1000 episodes of TV. Quite frankly,
                    that's too long, and the anime's pacing is rather slow often. So, even though
                    it's technically cheating, I actually have been reading more One Piece than I've
                    been watching these days. <br /> The story tells of a young boy who wants to
                    become the king of the pirates, sailing across the world while picking up new
                    friend after new friend. Their adventures get preeeetty wacky! <br />I'm a big
                    fan of how this world treats powers, especially early on. </p>

                    got me hooked, and the second book (so far) has kept the energy pretty high! All
                    the characters' fates are up in the air, relationships are being formed and
                    tested, and, oh yeah, there's a battle for the crown going on! Who could ask for
                    more!</p>
