            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a senior, he plans to go into game
                design and development. <br />On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching,
                whatever book I'm reading, or whatever game I'm playing. I thought it would be fun
                to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my work!</p>

                    spoilers<br />I'm a huge fan of the Ace Attorney franchise, so when I saw that
                    another of Shu Takumi's games was being remastered for modern consoles I was
                    very excited! Ghost Trick features one of the most unique gameplay mechanics
                    I've ever seen, that being the player taking the role of a poltergeist to
                    manipulate objects and environments to save peoples' lives! It's truly
                    fascinating just how outlandish they get with their puzzles. I have some gripes,
                    those mostly being the gameplay feeling extremely segmented, if that makes
                    sense. It felt quite formulaic at the start with how you would solve a puzzle,
                    read a cutscene (the game features a lot of visual-novel-like elements), then
                    progress to the next area. I'm currently in the later stages of the game, and
                    the loop has evolved quite a bit. I'm excited to finish it! <span
                        class="playSpoiler"><br /> I think I'm in the final stages now, with the
                        final twist having been revealed! Brace yourself...I was a cat the whole
                        time? I mean, I have to admit, I didn't expect it! But I'm pretty interested
                        to see where it goes next. There was even some time travel hijinx the last
                        time I played!</span></p>

                    spoilers<br /> One Piece has some of the best world-building I've ever seen in
                    such an elongated series, but it's kind of hard to watch sometimes. The pacing
                    in the anime is very difficult to get through! It would definitely be more
                    enjoyable to watch weekly if you were caught up with the story. <br /><span
                        class="watchSpoiler">I feel like One Piece is definitely more enjoyable if
                        you're involved with the fandom/community. So much of what I see people
                        online enjoy about the series is fanart of one of the Straw Hats or talking
                        about the crazy new development in the latest chapter. But as a semi-casual
                        fan, it's kind of irritating, since nothing in the series has really been a
                        surprise to me. I knew about Robin's entire introduction arc, as well as all
                        the characters who would go on to join the Straw Hat crew like Franky and
                        Jinbei. For large stuff like that I understand not tiptoeing around, but I
                        feel like I constantly see slips/screenshots of the newest episode/chapter
                        that I would just enjoy more if I saw naturally. Perhaps it is all the
                        internet's fault...</span></p>

                    book was pretty gut-wrenching, <span class="readSpoiler">I mean seriously, is
                        Brienne okay???,</span> and having the knowledge I have now, that being
                    George R.R. Martin refusing to finish his series, it makes it even more painful,
                    but I'm still incredibly invested in the plights of Westeros. I thought that
                    book 4's approach was very exciting, including chapters led by characters that
                    had been side characters before <span class="readSpoiler">(Obviously, Brienne
                        sort of became my favorite character in the series for this very reason,
                        Cersei was fun to read as well)</span>, and book 5 is more of a return to
                    form, kind of posthumously making book 4 a Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2 situation. And
                    if you don't understand that reference, go watch Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2!<br />
