            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a junior, <br /> he plans to go into
                game design and development. </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching, whatever book I'm reading, or
                whatever game I'm playing. </p>
            <p>I thought it would be fun to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my
                work!</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>Currently Playing: Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</h2>
            <p>I've been a fan of Ace Attorney for a long time by now, and I've played (and loved)
                all the Professor Layton games that were on <br />the Nintendo DS, but I'd never
                actually played this crossover title. It took a Let's Play channel's playthrough of
                the series <br /> to finally get me to check it out myself. I knew I would enjoy
                their videos, but moreso if I had played the game previously. It's pretty good so
                far, <br />I'm a huge fan of puzzle and mystery games where you have to figure out
                the solution yourself.</p>

            <h2>Currently Watching: The Last of Us on HBO Max</h2>
            <p>The Last of Us is honestly one of the best games I've ever played, and its sequel is
                pretty good too! When I heard that they'd <br />be making a TV show adaptation, I
                was excited, but it's hard to get hyped for something that seems so far away. Well
                as of now, the show is finally coming out with a new <br />episode every week, and
                it's been incredible so far. If you're a fan of dystopian fiction, zombies, found
                family plots, or just plain well-written drama, I'd recommend it!</p>

            <h2>Currently Reading: The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h2>
            <p>When I was younger, I would read all the time, but I don't carve out time to read as
                much these days. I still buy tons <br />of books, however. A recent purchase was
                    <i>The Ultimate Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, a book I'd wanted to read
                for a while. It contains all five books in the series <br />(which I didn't know
                existed, really), and it's been okay so far. Something has been nagging me about it,
                though. In the foreword, there's notes about how the author, Douglas Adams, <br />
                never really wanted to be an author, and resented his series' success. I might be imagining things when I read it, but I feel as if I can detect a hint of that cynicism througout the books.</p>
