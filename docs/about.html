            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a junior, he plans to go into game design and development. </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching, whatever book I'm reading, or
                whatever game I'm playing. I thought it would be fun to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my
                work!</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>Currently Playing: Paper Mario and the Thousand-Year Door</h2>
            <p>Paper Mario is a really interesting game series. Originally, it was called Mario Story, but the name changed to Paper Mario for
             English localization. The most recent games have relied too much on gimmicky craft worlds, instead of engaging stories or gameplay, at
             least that's the opinion of many. I have to agree that the classic Paper Mario games are a lot more fun than the modern ones, yet \
            despite having heard how good Paper Mario TTYD was, I've never played it, in fact, I know virtually nothing about the game, and I'm 
            really excited to play it for the first time.</p>

            <h2>Currently Watching: Better Call Saul on Netflix</h2>
            <p>Since last updating this site, I binged the entirety of the TV show <i>Breaking Bad</i>.
             I'd heard how amazing the show was before, of course, and was delighted when my expectations were fulfilled. I was equally
             pleased when I learned that an entire prequel series already existed, and the final season would be streaming on Netflix by the beginning 
            of the summer. What luck! Regardless, <i>Better Call Saul</i> has been a really interesting watch so far, and an awesome fix for anyone 
            wanting more of what made <i>Breaking Bad</i> so great.</p>

            <h2>Currently Reading: The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h2>
            <p>When I was younger, I would read all the time, but I don't carve out time to read as
                much these days. I still buy tons of books, however. A recent purchase was <i>The
                    Ultimate Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, a book I'd wanted to read for a
                while. It contains all five books in the series (which I didn't know existed,
                really), and it's been okay so far. Something has been nagging me about it, though.
                In the foreword, there's notes about how the author, Douglas Adams, never really
                wanted to be an author, and resented his series' success. I might be imagining
                things when I read it, but I feel as if I can detect a hint of that cynicism
                througout the books.</p>
