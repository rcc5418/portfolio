            <p>Reece Cullen (that's me) is a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) student at
                Penn State Behrend, the Erie College. Currently a senior, he plans to go into game
                design and development. <br />On this page, I'll put whatever show I'm watching,
                whatever book I'm reading, or whatever game I'm playing. I thought it would be fun
                to give you a eensy glimpse into my life beyond my work!</p>

                        Phantom Detective</span><br />I'm a huge fan of the Ace Attorney franchise,
                    so when I saw that another of Shu Takumi's games was being remastered for modern
                    consoles I was very excited! Ghost Trick features one of the most unique
                    gameplay mechanics I've ever seen, that being the player taking the role of a
                    poltergeist to manipulate objects and environments to save peoples' lives! It's
                    truly fascinating just how outlandish they get with their puzzles. I have some
                    gripes, those mostly being the gameplay feeling extremely segmented, if that
                    makes sense. It felt quite formulaic at the start with how you would solve a
                    puzzle, read a cutscene (the game features a lot of visual-novel-like elements),
                    then progress to the next area. I'm currently in the later stages of the game,
                    and the loop has evolved quite a bit. I'm excited to finish it!</p>

                        Piece</span><br /> One Piece has some of the best world-building I've ever
                    seen in such an elongated series, but it's kind of hard to watch sometimes. The
                    pacing in the anime is very difficult to get through! It would definitely be
                    more enjoyable to watch weekly if you were caught up with the story.</p>

                    of the last book was pretty gut-wrenching, and having the knowledge I have know,
                    that being George R.R. Martin refusing to finish his series, it makes it even
                    more painful, but I'm still incredibly invested in the plights of Westeros. I
                    thought that book 4's approach was very exciting, including chapters led by
                    characters that had been side characters before, and book 5 is more of a return
                    to form, kind of posthumously making book 4 a Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2 situation.
                    And if you don't understand that reference, go watch Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2!</p>
